// Here are two extra challenges you can try out.
// You can solve them entirely using the techniques you've
// you've learned so far, no extra knowledge is required.

// However, they will be tricky. If you find them a challenge
// don't worry, it doesn't mean you're not a good programmer,
// it just means they're challenging!

// I've also given you a bit more room in the canvas. You can
// change this in `09/index.html` if you like by changing
// `250` to whatever you like.

// There's no order, you can pick whichever you like, or invent
// your own challenge.

// ## More Letters
// If you're bored with a-z, here's a challenge for you.
// Write the titles of these Wikipedia articles:
// * https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hant/庄子
// * https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/جبر (Don't forget to go right to left!)
// Or perhaps make a sentence out of a few of these:
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Egyptian_hieroglyphs

// ## Lines Only
// Implement the functions `markRightLine`, `markLeftLine`,
// `markUpLine`, and `markDownLine` which draw a line of dots.
// Can you implement all of your letters using the new functions
// instead of `markDot`?

// ## Joined Up
// Most people use joined up handwriting rather than printing
// each letter individually. Can you adapt your program to
// write in this way? How will you handle the 'handover'
// between letters?
